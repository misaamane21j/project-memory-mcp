# Project Memory MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI-driven project memory management through structured prompts. This server acts as a **pure prompt provider** - it never touches your files directly. Instead, it returns instructions for Claude to execute using its standard tools.

## What is This?

`project-memory-mcp` helps Claude manage your project context by:

- **Parsing tasks** from specs and implementation plans
- **Reviewing code** before commits
- **Syncing project memory** with commit history
- **Maintaining project documentation** (architecture, conventions, commands)

All operations are performed by Claude using its Read, Write, Edit, and Bash tools after getting your approval.

## Key Features

✅ **Pure prompt provider** - No file access, only returns instructions
✅ **Interface-agnostic** - Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code CLI, or custom clients
✅ **No API costs** - Uses your existing Claude subscription
✅ **User approval required** - Claude asks before making any changes
✅ **Project-specific prompts** - Customized during initialization for your stack
✅ **200-line limit** - Prevents context bloat

## Installation

Install globally from GitHub:

```bash
npm install -g git+https://github.com/misaamane21j/project-memory-mcp.git
```

## Setup

### Configure MCP in Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-memory": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "project-memory-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure MCP in Claude Code CLI

Add to your user config at `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "project-memory": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "project-memory-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
This will make the mcp available in all your project.

### Restart Claude

Restart Claude Desktop or Claude Code CLI to load the MCP server.

## Usage

### Initialize Project Memory

In your project directory, ask Claude:

```
"Initialize project memory"
```

Claude will:
1. Create `.project-memory/` folder structure
2. Analyze your project (language, frameworks, structure, conventions)
3. Generate and customize project-specific prompts (base.md, parse-tasks.md, review.md, sync.md)
4. Populate initial documentation files (architecture.md, conventions.md, useful-commands.md) with detected project info
5. Add minimal IMPORTANT reference to `claude.md`

**Important:** Each prompt file is limited to ≤ 200 lines to prevent context bloat.

### Parse Tasks from Specs

Add a spec file to `.project-memory/specs/feature-name.md`, then ask Claude:

```
"Parse tasks from the spec"
```

Claude will:
1. Read the spec file
2. Extract tasks with IDs, descriptions, acceptance criteria, dependencies
3. Show you the parsed tasks
4. After approval, add them to `.project-memory/tasks/tasks-active.json`

### Review Code Before Committing

Before committing, ask Claude:

```
"Review my changes"
```

Claude will:
1. Get `git diff` and `git diff --cached`
2. Read current tasks and architecture
3. Analyze code for issues
4. Propose task status updates
5. After approval, update project memory

### Sync After Commits

After committing, ask Claude:

```
"Sync project memory"
```

Claude will:
1. Get recent commit history
2. Determine completed tasks
3. Update commit log (last 20 commits)
4. Update architecture if changed
5. After approval, apply updates

### Organize Existing CLAUDE.md

For existing projects with verbose CLAUDE.md files, ask Claude:

```
"Organize my CLAUDE.md into project memory"
```

Claude will:
1. Read and analyze your CLAUDE.md
2. Identify sections: architecture, conventions, commands, tasks, specs
3. Show migration plan with line numbers
4. After approval, migrate content to `.project-memory/` files
5. Replace verbose sections with minimal references in CLAUDE.md

**Example migration:**
- Architecture (75 lines) → `.project-memory/architecture.md`
- Conventions (60 lines) → `.project-memory/conventions.md`
- Commands (30 lines) → `.project-memory/useful-commands.md`
- Tasks → `.project-memory/tasks/tasks-active.json`
- Specs → `.project-memory/specs/*.md`

**Result:** CLAUDE.md stays clean with just references, detailed content lives in organized files.

### Proactive Prompting

After initialization, Claude will automatically prompt you:

- **When you provide a spec:** "Would you like me to parse tasks?"
- **Before commits:** "Would you like me to review your changes?"
- **After commits:** "Would you like me to sync project memory?"
- **Session start:** Check for pending reviews/syncs

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
.project-memory/
├── tasks/
│   ├── tasks-active.json       # Active and in-progress tasks
│   └── tasks-completed.json    # Completed tasks
├── specs/
│   └── *.md                    # Immutable spec files (you create these)
├── prompts/
│   ├── base.md                 # Core instructions (≤200 lines)
│   ├── parse-tasks.md          # Task parsing workflow (≤200 lines)
│   ├── review.md               # Code review workflow (≤200 lines)
│   ├── sync.md                 # Post-commit sync workflow (≤200 lines)
│   └── languages/              # Optional language-specific extensions
├── architecture.md             # Project architecture docs
├── conventions.md              # Coding conventions
├── useful-commands.md          # Common commands
└── commit-log.md               # Last 20 commits
```

## Task Schema

Tasks follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-001",
  "title": "Brief description",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "status": "pending | in_progress | completed",
  "priority": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "acceptanceCriteria": ["criterion 1", "criterion 2"],
  "dependencies": ["TASK-000"],
  "subtasks": [
    {
      "id": "TASK-001-1",
      "title": "Sub-task title",
      "status": "pending",
      "acceptanceCriteria": ["optional"]
    }
  ],
  "specReference": "specs/feature-auth.md",
  "complexity": "simple | moderate | complex",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-16T14:30:00Z",
  "completedAt": null
}
```

## MCP Tools

The server exposes 5 tools (all return prompts only):

### `init`
Initialize project memory system. Run once per project.

### `parse-tasks`
Parse tasks from spec files or implementation plans.

### `review`
Review uncommitted code changes against project context.

### `sync`
Sync project memory with recent commits.

### `organize`
Organize existing CLAUDE.md into project-memory structure. Migrates architecture, conventions, commands, tasks, and specs from verbose CLAUDE.md to organized files.

```

## Architecture Principles

1. **MCP is a pure prompt provider**
   - Only returns text instructions
   - Never reads/writes project files
   - Never executes git commands

2. **Claude does all the work**
   - Uses standard tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash)
   - User sees all operations
   - Requires approval via AskUserQuestion

3. **Project-specific customization**
   - Prompts tailored to your tech stack
   - Language-specific guidelines
   - Framework conventions

4. **200-line limit per prompt**
   - Prevents context bloat
   - Keeps prompts focused
   - Enforced during init
